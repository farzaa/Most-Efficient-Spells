BEFORE YOU RUN THE PROGRAM
Before doing anything, we need to install a module called "requests".  It allows my program to grab data from Riots API.  Without it, the program probably won't start.
1. Download Python Version 2.7.10: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Change your enviroment variables so that you can use Python in Command Prompt (My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables). Once your in Enviroment Variables, click PATH, then Edit, and add your Python path.  
Mines is  "C:\Python27".  Type in "python" in command line to ensure you did this correctly.  Close and reopen Command Prompt. 

3. In Command Prompt, change your directory (using the "cd" command) to where my program and all its files are.

4. We need to install pip. So once your in my programs directory, type "python get-pip.py" which is included in my ZIP file.

5. Now add pip to your enviroment variables so you can use pip in Command Prompt (My Computer -> Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables).  Once your in Enviroment Variables, click PATH, then Edit, and add your Python 
scripts path.  Mines is "C:\Python27\Scripts".  Type in "pip" in command line to ensure you did this correctly.  Close and reopen Command Prompt. 

6. Finally, install requests. Simply type in "pip install requests"



HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
Now you can run the program through Command Line or an IDE.  I reccomend using an IDE since Command Line messes up some of programs formatting due to its small window size. 
I reccomend using IDLE, which comes with Python 2.7.10.  To do this, simply open main.py with IDLE and run the program.

If you want to use Command Line (be sure to make the window as big as possible), change directories to where my program and all its files are (using the "cd" command).  Once your there, type "python main.py" and it will run.
