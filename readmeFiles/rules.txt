Breif Video Walkthrough of my Program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HUoeWlMr8E

My program follows a certain set of rules I made and I use them to be as consistent as possible in my calculations.
1. This program looks at a single spell in isolation. It does not take into account passives and enemy resistances. We only look at straight damage. 
2. Champion abilities that come from their R do not count. (ex. Nidalee, Karma, Kha'Zix). The R is seen as an isolated ability, so if the Q and R interact, that 
interaction would be nullified. 
3. Mana is always unlimited. Energy does not regen.
4. Certain auto attack based abilities do not count (ex. Vayne W, Annie E, Tryndamere Q)  because they require attack speed calculations which is not part of the program. 
5. Hybrid ratios are calculated.
6. The only type of damage that this program doesn't account for is damage based on health (sorry Mundo). 
7. A base AD is given to every champion to calculate total Attack Damage. 
8. Base AP is always zero. 
9. We assume no runes/masteries. 


Keep being awesome
